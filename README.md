# LSTM-for-Dynamic-system
Comparing 3 types of LSTMs for Dynamic system: Classic LSTM, Multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM) and LSTM with Attention.

Difference metrics are included: MSE, Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence and 2-Wasserstein Distance.

Data is from topographic barotropic model, which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ceFUYHvZWMh35JWEAhDpjvoK0RK_fKbu?usp=sharing.

run `train_model_para.py` to train model

run `pred_model.py` to make prediction
