# LSTM-for-Dynamic-system
3 types of LSTMs for Dynamic system.

Data is from topographic barotropic model.

`classic_LSTM_barotropic.py`, `mLSTM_barotropic.py`, `LSTM_attention_barotropic.py` correspond to different types of LSTMs.

`comparison_barotropic.py` compares to the performance of trained models of different LSTMs.
